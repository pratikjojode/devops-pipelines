# DevOps-Pipelines

## Introduction

Welcome to **DevOps-Pipelines**, a project designed to demonstrate the power of **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** using **GitHub Actions**.

This is **my first pipeline code**, created to **test and learn CI/CD automation** with a Node.js application. The workflow automates crucial development tasks, including:

- **Code Checkout** – Automatically retrieves the latest code from your repository.
- **Dependency Installation** – Installs all required npm packages.
- **Linting** – Ensures code quality and enforces coding standards.
- **Testing** – Runs unit tests to verify that your application works as expected.
- **Build Automation** – Compiles the application and prepares it for deployment.

By using this pipeline, developers can focus on writing code while ensuring that their application is **tested, built, and ready for production** automatically.
